# KairosDB Logo


I already shared this logo on [KairosDB discussion group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kairosdb-group) in 2013, I believe it's better to give it to the KairosDB community in a more visible way using GitHub. 


## Interpretation of the logo

This is a pretty simple work, but there's a tiny bit of thought behind.


The blue Arrow represents the opportunity/supreme moment in the Kairos concept, and symbolize the raised hair tuft of Kairos god that can be grasped to seize the opportunity, while (it's pointless to mention) the clock represents the time domain.



# About Kairos and KairosDB 

## KairosDB 

[KairosDB](https://github.com/kairosdb/kairosdb) is a scalable, resilient, reliable and modular time series database using Apache Cassandra as a storage backend. 

## Kairos 

[Kairos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kairos) is the ultimate momment and/or the opportunity in ancient greek.

The Greek god Kairos is represented by a young man wearing nothing but a hair tuft on the head. When Kairos is comes close to us, there are three possibilities:

- we do not see him (missed opportunity)
- We see him and do nothing (missed opportunity) 
- when he comes, we throw our hand to grasp his tuft of hair and so we take the opportunity.

Kairos gave the Latin opportunitas (opportunity).
